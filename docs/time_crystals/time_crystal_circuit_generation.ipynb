    "# Time Crystal Circuit Generation\n",
    "This notebook covers how Many Body Local Discrete Time Crystal circuit lists are created, from the paper: Observation of Time-Crystalline Eigenstate Order on a Quantum Processor ([arxiv:2107.13571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13571)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers, and gate-based quantum circuits turn out to be well suited for crafting systems that exhibit time-crystalline behavior. Behavior is crystalline with respect to time if it has some consistent and stable pattern over time. This system's pattern must be resilient against perturbation, including the introduction of random noise and heat, in the same way that a space-crystalline object, like a diamond, stays in shape if moved or heated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of a time-crystalline system on a quantum computer starts with a set of qubits that are connected in a single chain. This serves as a many body local system which, at the low superconducting temperature that the qubits are run at, becomes resistant to changes cause by small amounts of introduced heat. The heat's energy is spread across the qubits, thin enough that it is not sufficient to change the qubits' states. The amount of heat dissipation in the DTC circuits is modeled with the thermalization constant `g`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual time-crystalline behavior that the DTC circuits implement is perhaps the simplest possible kind of time-structured behavior, oscillation. Each circuit is built with some number of identical $U$-cycles. Time is represented by a circuit list where each circuit is ordered with increasingly many $U$-cycles; each cycle is a discrete time step. The eventual effect of these $U$-cycles, as demonstrated in the paper and in the [Time Crystal Data Analysis](time_crystal_data_analysis.ipynb) notebook, is consistent oscillations of each qubits' polarizations. Each $U$-cycle includes a component to model to model the influence of thermalization, with the constant `g`,  and random noise, with the `local_fields` variables. The behavior of the DTC circuits is shown to be time-crystalline in spite of the consistently introduced randomness. "

The qubits are connected in a chain, and each qubit pair connection in that chain is coupled with a `cirq.PhasedFSimGate` that uses the parameters `[theta, zetas, chi, gamma, phi]`. To keep gates from overlapping on the same qubit, this chain of gates is split into the second and third moments, such that no two gates share a qubit within each moment. \n",
